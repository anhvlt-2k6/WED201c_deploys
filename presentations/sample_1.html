        <table> is a table 
            <tr> Used to define a row inside a table
            <th> Used to define a cell (header) within the row
            <td> Used to define a (normal) cell within the row
        Exclusively, 3 special components:
            <thead> Used to determine which rows belong to the "head" of the table
            <tbody> Used to determine which rows belong to the "body" of the table
            <tfoot> Used to determine which rows are in the "footers" of the table
        
        <caption> is for title of the table
        
        - To merge cells horizontally, we put the “colspan” attribute inside the opening
        tag of the cell where we want to start merging it with the cells on the right.
        - To merge cells vertically, we put the “rowspan” attribute inside the opening
        tag of the cell where we want to start merging it with the cells below.
